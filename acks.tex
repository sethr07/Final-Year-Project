First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor Dr. Stephen Farrell. Without him and his constant guidance and contributions, this project would not be possible. Thank you for your time 
and patience. I have gained a lot more than just knowledge from you.

\noindent Next, my parents and my sister, without whom I would not be here. You guys are everything.

\noindent Last but not least, my friends in Dublin and India. Thank you for having faith in me when I did not believe in myself.
